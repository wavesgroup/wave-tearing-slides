## Takeaways

1. We derived a simple model for wave tearing by wind.
2. Quadratic in $ak$ and quartic in $U$
3. _Qualitatively_ reproduces the observed behavior of waves in extreme winds.
5. Next steps:
  * Implement the numerical tearing model for fully nonlinear waves
  * Validate it with laboratory measurements
  * Test it in a spectral wave model

## Assumptions and limitations

* Crest tear to spume distribution is instantaneous
* Analytical solution limited to small amplitude waves; numerical solution
  is needed for tearing of steep waves
* Wind log profile down to the crest (constant flux layer assumed)
* No whitecap effects
