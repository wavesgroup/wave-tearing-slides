### Holthuijsen et al. (2012): Whitecaps, streaks, and spume from airborne photography

<blockquote>
"A breaking wave creates a patch of active foam at its crestâ€“the white cap.
...
At very high wind speeds the white cap is blown off the crest in a layer of
spray droplets.
Under such conditions, the ocean-atmosphere interface is a foam, spray, bubble
emulsion layer, which acts as a slip layer for the wind, rather than as a
liquid surface.""

## However, it can't be only whitecaps...

* Observed whitecap fractions are too low to support complete whiteout
* Wind forces are strong enough to blow off liquid water parcels
* Rapid dissipation of waves can't be explained by whitecapping alone

    <ul style="font-size: 0.9em;">
      <li><b>Top</b>: Gently sloped, young, windsea saturate in height with increasing wind speed and fetch</li>
      <li><b>Bottom</b>: Steep waves grow and suddenly dissipate past a critical wind speed and fetch</li>
      <li>Whitecapping cannot account for the rate of dissipation observed at $U_{10} \gtrsim 35\ m/s$ and fetch > ~8 m</li>
      <li><b>Hypothesis</b>: Wave tearing occurs when waves become steep enough under sufficiently strong winds, leading to sudden and rapid wave dissipation.</li>

## What is wave tearing by wind?

* Shear instability between wind and surface waves
* Tops of steep wave crests detach and disperse
* Can overlap with, but is independent from, whitecapping
* $\rightarrow$ Rapid dissipation of wave energy
* $\rightarrow$ Rapid generation of spume and spray
</section>


<section>

## State of the art

* Not well understood
* Difficult to measure
* Not considered by ocean wave prediction models
* No theoretical or empirical models for wave tearing

## Can we formulate a theoretical or empirical model for wave tearing?
