## Tearing criterion: Mechanical energy from wind into surface tension energy of spume

For a water parcel to detach from the crest and break up into
spume, it needs to receive energy from wind.

The wind does work on a sloped surface of the wave via aerodynamic drag.

The mechanical energy received by aerodynamic drag is entirely converted
into surface tension energy that holds all spume droplets.
