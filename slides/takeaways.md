## Takeaways

1. We derived a simple model for wave tearing by wind.
2. Analytical solution for tear depth for small amplitude waves:
$$
\frac{\delta}{a} = \left( \frac{\rho C_D U^2 a k r}{\sigma} \right)^2
$$
3. The model qualitatively reproduces the observed wave tearing behavior.
4. Results are sensitive to wave nonlinearity and spume droplet radius distribution.
5. Next steps:
  * Quantitatively validate with laboratory measurements
  * Test in a spectral wave model

## Assumptions and limitations

* Only one wave considered
* No transition, *i.e.* crest tearing to final spume distribution is instantaneous 
* No change in potential (*i.e.* no lift) or kinetic energy (*i.e.* no acceleration) of the water parcel
* No whitecap effects 

All of these can and will be improved upon.
